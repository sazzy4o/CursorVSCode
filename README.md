# Getting Started

1. Search for **CursorCode** in the [vscode extension store](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meteorstudio.cursorcode) to install

2. Select the Cursor cursor icon on the left to enter the dialog page
3. You can directly enter questions, or select code in the code box to ask
4. Right-click on the code in the code box or right-click on a blank space, click **CursorCode** in the pop-up menu, and enter the requirements (generate/optimize code) in the input box

> Note: Please click in the code box before asking, so that the cursor stays in one place (to help the AI better understand the code context)
